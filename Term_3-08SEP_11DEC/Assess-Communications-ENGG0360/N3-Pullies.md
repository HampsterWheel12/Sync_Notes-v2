# Mechanical advantage
1. Mechanical advantage is the application of force over a longer distance. Think of it as walking 5km vs running it. The distance (energy) is the same but it takes less effort but more time to walk it.

1. A pulley is a simple mechanical device of the first-order lever category consisting of a wheel and groove through which a cable, rope or chain passes.
2. The pulley shaft is fixed in a fork ending in a hook.
3. Tension on the wire is what allows a rope to lift an object
4. Bearing pullies are high performance with efficiency almost equal to 1 (no resistence)
5. Exponential hoist with 3 pulleys
    - Fixed pullies are used to change direction of force
6. Pully systems (hoists are combinations of fixed pully systems that reduce driving force with the ability to change the direction of pullies.
### Exponential hoist
- Big mechanical advantage
- Large space and can be easily dirupted when the cable jumps off the cable

This paper observes the behavior of systems under real situations to account for the environmental forces. These simulated forces allows design considerations to be discovered and tested to account for those variables.
1. Force deformation characteristics
2. Loading criterial for earthquakes and wind
3. Behavior of systems under load
4. Prototype model that is scaled down for testing
### Shaking table test
