# Wikipedia Background Notes on [Cranes][1] 
## History
1. Cranes are levers and pulleys used to create a mechanical advantage
2. The use dates back to ancient Mesopotamia
3. Introduction of **winch** and **pulley** led to the replacement of ramps
    - Objects could probably be lifted up higher surfaces if the crane had **leverage**
    - The Egyptians may have pushed blocks up inclines as they may have not used pulley cranes yet
4. The Roman "polyspastos" was a crane which could move up to **3,000kg/person** operating the treadwheel compared to the Egyptians who required 50 men to push a 5,000kg stone up an incline
    - The incline was not specified and the mechanical advantage provided is around 1:60
5. The Medieval period readopted the treadwheel crane as vertical transport is **safer** and **cheaper** 
    - They used wheels that were turned around a central shaft usually large enough for 2 workers
6. Obelisks were normally large cranes that supported construction around the area
7. The Industrial revolution saw the widespread adoption of cranes for loading and unloading ships
    - The hydraulic jigger was also invented by [Sir William Armstrong][2] 
    - This also led to the development of the hydraulic accumulator which used incompressible liquid hydraulic fluid
## Design Considerations
1. **Stability:** the sum of all moments about the base must be close to zero so that the crane does not overturn
2. **Dynamic Lift Factor:** changing factors that must be considered when designing a crane
    - Hoisting Acceleration and Deceleration
    - Crane movement such as slewing or luffing
    - Load swinging
    - Wind forces
    - Operator error
## General Catergories
Cranes are generally used in construction, industrial application like lifting waste products, cargo handling such as unloading, loading, and relocating shipping containers
1. Truck mounted
2. Crawler
3. Pick and carry
4. Tower
5. Gantry
