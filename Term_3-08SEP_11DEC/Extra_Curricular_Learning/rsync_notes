1) Addressing: use username and server IP adddress (name@ip)
2) Location: name@ip:/path/to/directory
3) Useful flags and arguments:
	-rv (recursive, verbose)
	--dry-run (shows what it would've copied and the size)
4) Restoring: same command but reverse the input and output
	name:ip:/path/to/directory/ olddirectory/
	The / at the end tells the computer not to create a new directory
5) Adding --delete will remove any files that aren't apart of the source (useful for renamed files)
6) Adding -a flag will change the metadata
7) remove-source-files is useful for transfering files like a mv command
